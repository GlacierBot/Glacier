Glacier
=======

Glacier is an advanced (or aims to be) Minecraft Bot API. With support for plugins and an event system.

We aim to provide a Protocol system using plugins, allowing you to run multiple bots with multiple different versions simultaneously.

## Using SNAPSHOT builds
These versions of Glacier are unstable and unsupported - using these builds is done so at your own risk and is _not_ recommended.
If you encounter an issue with one of the Snapshot builds, please report the issue or create a pull request with a fix.

Any issues with external dependencies should be reported to their respective repository, unless of course the issue with an external dependency is caused by an error in Glacier's code.

We do encourage that you test SNAPSHOT builds if you are an experienced Java developer. We do this so that we can push out a fully functional build as soon as possible!

## Compiling SNAPSHOT builds
Compiling Glacier should be as simple as running `mvn clean install`. In the event that the project fails to compile, report the issue or create a pull request with a fix.
